## Explanation
This project aims to design a **smart microphone** with the capability of **sound source localization**. The system is composed of an array of multiple microphones that, through algorithms and signal processing, allows for highly precise determination of the location of a sound within an environment.

### Main Objective:
The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional sound localization methods by improving precision and sensitivity through an innovative and efficient system. An **Arduino microcontroller** is used for central processing, along with three microphones to capture sounds from different points and triangulate the position of the sound source.

### Key Components:
1. **Arduino** as the control unit.
2. **Three microphones** to capture sound waves and determine the location of the source using geometry.
3. **Bluetooth module** for wireless communication and data transmission.
4. **LCD screen** to visually display the location of the sound.
5. **Assembly language** for programming the system, optimizing performance in hardware control.

### System Applications:
The system has several possible applications, including:
- Detecting people by sound in robotics,
- Locating noise in industrial processes,
- Surveillance and security,
- Rescue missions, where it could help locate people in disaster areas using sound information.

### Requirements:
- **Precision**: The system must locate the sound with a maximum error margin of Â±1 degree.
- **Latency**: The response should be real-time, with a delay of no more than 100 milliseconds between detecting the sound and displaying the location.
- **Mobile Interface**: A mobile app will be developed to display the sound's position, allowing remote control of the system via Bluetooth.

This project aims to create an accessible and low-cost solution for sound localization systems using affordable components and open technologies like Arduino.

## Installation

Uploading a **.aia** file in **MIT App Inventor** is simple. **.aia** files are complete MIT App Inventor projects that can be imported, modified, and further developed. Follow these steps to upload a **.aia** file:

### Steps to Upload a .aia File in MIT App Inventor:
1. **Access MIT App Inventor**:
   - Open your web browser and go to the [MIT App Inventor website](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu).
   - Log in with your Google account.
   
2. **Go to Projects**:
   - Once inside the MIT App Inventor environment, click on the **"Projects"** menu in the top left corner.

3. **Select "Import project"**:
   - From the dropdown menu, select **"Import project (.aia) from my computer"**.

4. **Choose the .aia file**:
   - A file explorer window will open. Navigate to the location on your computer where the **.aia** file is stored.
   - Select the file and click **"Open"**.

5. **Wait for the upload**:
   - MIT App Inventor will begin uploading the file. This may take a few seconds depending on the size of the project.

6. **Project uploaded**:
   - Once the upload is complete, your project will appear in the list of projects in MIT App Inventor. You can click on the project name to open it and start working on it.

### What can you do after uploading the file?
- Once the **.aia** file is uploaded, you will be able to see both the interface design and the code blocks you have previously configured.
- From there, you can continue editing the project, add new features, or export it again if needed.

With these simple steps, you can import and continue working on your projects in MIT App Inventor.
